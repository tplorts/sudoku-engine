## Setup

You will need `g++` available.  On Mac, this should be taken care of by the Xcode command line tools.

If you want to use `clang-format` for code formatting, use homebrew on Mac:
```
brew install clang-format
```

## Running

Run these commands in the `cpp/` directory.

### Compile
```
make
```

### Execute
```
./solve
```
